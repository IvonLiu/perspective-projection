# Cube

Currently this is capable of projecting a cube into a 2D plane. The cube is defined by 8 points, in a left-handed coordinate system. The vertices are numbered as such: 
    
        v7 ------- v6
       /|          /|
      / |         / |
    v4 -|------ v5  |
    |  v3 ------|--v2  
    |  /        |  /
    | /         | /
    v0--------- v1
